Changelog
=========

Here's the list of changes in each released version.


v0.9.1
------

* Added the `clear` functions for terminals and screens.
* Added the `get-size` functions for terminals and screens.
* Relies on a snapshot release of Lanterna so may not be stable.

v0.9.0
------

Initial prerelease.  The architecture won't change but the API might.  Until
version `1.0.0` I reserve the right to break things indiscriminately.
